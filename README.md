React. Make component Carousel.jsx

Implement a component that emulates the slider. The component takes as input the images property,
which contains a list of paths to the images. The component displays them and allows you to use
the arrows "forward" and "backward" to navigate through them. The transition itself is loopy.
Pictures (paths to them) can be repeated.
